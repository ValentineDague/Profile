          Wassup ? I'm Valentine, presumably stuck in the 90s.
          <br>Training as a web developer at Wagon Lyon from January 15 to March 15, 2023, one of my life-goal is working for companies that share my values and passions, and I'm lucky: I've got plenty of them!
          <br>
          Internationally <a href="https://www.saber-tour.com/" target=_blank> ranked in SSL lightsaber combat</a>, I am mobile anywhere as long as a training club is nearby.

    <h2>
    Full stack development
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br> Code is a passion that I was lucky enough to discover a few years ago.
Why choose between front and back end when you can play with both? Hire me for my multitasking and flexibility.

  <h2>
    Boardgames and escape games
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br> There hasn't been a day in the last 5 years when I haven't played a board game. I love games. Understanding their mechanics, devising strategies, communicating, playing again and again until I'm unbeatable... My friends fear me as soon as a box opens!
      <br> A good winner as well as a good loser, I'm passionate about logic and playing is enough for me, whatever the outcome.
Give me puzzles, problems to solve, kingdoms to build, please!
      <br>
I used to work in escape games as a communications manager and game master which enabled me to test over 150 rooms. Challenge me!

  <h2>
    Lightsaber combat
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br> A fighter for 3 years, I left the official lightsaber fights of the Fédération Française d'Escrime to join the SSL club in Paris.
<br>Lightsaber combat is a touch sport that demands dexterity, coordination and self-control, as the sabre is still a weapon.
Starting from nothing, I hope one day to reach the top 10 in the world.
<br>
I'm advancing slowly but surely, because this is the way.
